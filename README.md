Graham's Fedora WSL Setup
=========================

This repo sets up Fedora under WSL2 the way I happen to like.  It creates
and configures a Fedora WSL distro, and includes a script to easily launch
X11 apps from Windows.

To use this:

* Download Xming and Xming-fonts, or have them already installed.
* Edit Setup-Fedora-WSL.ps1 and set the variables at the top.
* Run Setup-Fedora-WSL.ps1.
* If prompted to reboot, do so and run the script again.
